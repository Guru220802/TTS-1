Earth is our special home planet, the only one we know that has life. It has water, air, and the perfect temperature for plants, animals, and people to live.

Now, if you eat 1 apple, how many are left? We subtract 1 from 5 to get 4 apples remaining.

But Pip wasn't afraid! Using creativity and courage, Pip found a way to help the baby bird return safely to its family. The other animals cheered and realized that being brave isn't about being big - it's about having a kind heart.
