  "title": "Day 3: Story Time - The Brave Little Mouse",
  "content": "Once upon a time, in a cozy little house, there lived a brave little mouse named Pip. Despite being small, Pip had a big heart and always helped friends in need.\n\nOne day, Pip heard crying from the garden. A baby bird had fallen from its nest and couldn't get back up. All the other animals were too scared to help because the nest was so high up.\n\nBut Pip wasn't afraid! Using creativity and courage, Pip found a way to help the baby bird return safely to its family. The other animals cheered and realized that being brave isn't about being big - it's about having a kind heart.\n\nToday we'll learn about courage, friendship, and believing in yourself! Sometimes the smallest person can make the biggest difference.",
