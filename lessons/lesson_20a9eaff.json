  "title": "Day 2: Basic Addition and Subtraction Magic",
  "content": "Let's learn the magic of numbers! Addition means putting things together to make more, while subtraction means taking things away.\n\nImagine you have 3 red apples and someone gives you 2 more green apples. How many apples do you have now? That's right - 5 apples! We added 3 plus 2 to get 5.\n\nNow, if you eat 1 apple, how many are left? We subtract 1 from 5 to get 4 apples remaining.\n\nWe'll practice with fun examples using toys, fruits, and animals! Math is everywhere around us, and once you understand these basics, you'll see numbers in a whole new way.",
